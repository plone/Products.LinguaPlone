Dynamic Views
=============

Environment
-----------

First, we are going to setup an environment:

  Use standard username and password from PloneTestCase
  >>> from Products.PloneTestCase.PloneTestCase import default_user
  >>> from Products.PloneTestCase.PloneTestCase import default_password

  Use the member's home folder as playground for the tests
  >>> folder = self.folder
  >>> folder_path = '/'.join(folder.getPhysicalPath())


Dynamic Actions
---------------

Make sure that the dynamic actions still works as expected.

  Let's try to use the 'sharing' dynamic action. It should
  send us to the folder local roles form screen:
  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET %s HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic %s:%s
  ... Cookie: I18N_LANGUAGE=en
  ... """ % (folder_path + '/@@sharing', default_user, default_password))
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Language: en
  ...Can add...
  ...Can edit...

Dynamic Layouts
---------------

Also make sure that the dynamic layouts still works as expected.

  Add a content item and define a different layout (summary) for the
  folder and try to access it:
  >>> folder.setLayout('folder_summary_view')
  >>> _ = folder.invokeFactory('SimpleType', 'doc')
  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET %s HTTP/1.1
  ... Cookie: I18N_LANGUAGE=en
  ... Authorization: Basic %s:%s
  ... """ % (folder_path, default_user, default_password))
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Language: en
  ...tileItem...
  ...tileHeadline...
  ...tileBody...
  ...tileFooter...
