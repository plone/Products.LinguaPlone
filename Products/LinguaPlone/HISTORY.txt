    [wichert]

  - Restructure the LinguaPlone product layout so it can be distributed
    as an egg.
    [wichert]


LinguaPlone 2.0beta1 - September 21, 2007

  - Allow translating the default view for an untranslated container
    again: we have correct code that adds a translation of the container
    as well now.
    [wichert]

  - Correct creationg of translations for objects which are the default
    view of a non-translatable parent.
    [wichert]

  - Correct handling of the translate into-menu for content with an
    untranslatable parent.
    [wichert]


LinguaPlone 2.0alpha2 - September 19, 2007

  - Only show the content menu if LinguaPlone is installed in the quick
    installer.
    [wichert]

  - Update functional tests to login as a member so the test can use unpublished
    content.
    [mj]

  - Disable the menu option to translate the default view for a folder to a
    language for which the folder has no translation.
    [wichert]


LinguaPlone 2.0alpha1 - September 10, 2007

  - Use a GenericSetup profile to install LinguaPlone.
    [wichert]

  - Move createTranslations to a @@translate browser view.
    [wichert]

  - Port to Plone 3.0.1.
    [wichert]


LinguaPlone 1.1 - UNRELEASED

  - Only allow linking to other objects of the same portal type.
    [wichert]

  - Add a sanity to prevent addTranslationReference from adding translations
    for languages which already have a translation.
    [wichert]

  - Policy change for language selector. We try to avoid disabled flags by
    looking for a translated parent.
    [fschulze]

  - Added UI to link translations together.
    [vlado, fschulze]

  - Changed to use _createObjectByType on addTranslation, bypassing possible
    conflicts with adding restrictions.
    [deo]


LinguaPlone 1.0 - Released June 19, 2007

  - If we are resetting the language due to a schema update do not delete the
    translation references. This fixes
    http://plone.org/products/linguaplone/issues/7
    [wichert]

  - Removed Plone 2.0 compatibility.
    [fschulze]

  - Add a utility method to link content objects as translations. This
    is useful, for example, in a GenericSetup import step to link content
    created in a GenericSetup content step.
    [wichert]

  - Show the 'Switch language to' text in the language selector in the
    target language instead of the current language.
    [wichert]

  - Fixed so rename after creation only happend on TTW creation. Not on
    first edit of a through script created object.
    [sashav]

  - Fixed an issue if theres no getTranslations available. This happens if
    an non-lp-enabled at-based object exists direct in portal-object.
    [jensens]

  - Fixed some code that spit out DeprecationWarnings.
    [hannosch]

  - Instead of customizing switchLanguage we now have portlet_languages
    inside LinguaPlone and use the much nicer languageSelectorData.
    [jladage]

  - LanguageIndex is now a specialised index that will return alternative
    translations within the main language when searching.
    [mj]


LinguaPlone 0.9.0 - Released June 16, 2006

  - Now works with Plone 2.5 out-of-the-box, and Plone 2.1.3 if using the
    included PloneLanguageTool.

  - Fixed unicode error on translated languages in Plone 2.1.3. It can
    contains non-ascii characters, so the default strings need to be
    declared as unicode.
    [encolpe]

  - Fixed actions to fallback gracefully for the action attribute 'name'
    and 'title'.
    [jladage] [encolpe]

  - Added the switchLanguage.py script and added support for translatable
    content.
    [jladage]

  - Fixed to lookup the language flag name directly from the language tool.
    Now, PloneLanguageTool 1.3 (or greater) is officially required.
    [deo]

  - Made tests compatible with Plone 2.5.
    [hannosch]

  - Some very minor i18n fixes.
    [hannosch]

  - Added a migration script to update language independent fields content.
    It *must* be manually run when upgrading from versions older than 0.9.
    [deo]

  - Removed the custom accessor/editAccessor generation. We're only using
    custom mutators and translation mutators for now. This result in a ~30%
    performance improvement over the previous versions.
    [deo]

  - Made sure to copy independent language fields data to all translations
    as we removed the custom accessor. This also fixed the problem when
    you try to get values direct from fields, as now the data is in the
    translations too, not only in the canonical object.
    [deo]

  - Forwared fix for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4939.
    [deo]

  - Fixed a problem when switching between translations of images/files,
    where the content was shown, instead of the view screen.
    [deo]

  - Fixed to highlight the 'Edit' tab from a translation when you click it.
    [deo]

  - Final cut on Plone 2.0 compatibility. Backported tests, handled
    migrations and patched tool with the PythonScripts content.
    [deo] [sidnei]

  - Added labels to language-independent fields.
    [deo] [limi]

  - Made the initial default language follow the PloneLanguageTool config
    policy.
    [deo]


LinguaPlone 0.9-beta - Released October 27, 2005

  - Removed content border from Translation Unavailable template.
    [limi]

  - Made the test fields that are not editable render in view mode, not as
    non-editable text boxes. The reasons for this are that people tend to
    think that "if it is a text box, it's editable", and are then confused
    when it's not (read-only widgets confuse the heck out of users), and the
    other reason is because it messes up multiple selection lists.
    [limi]

  - Made language-independent items not editable in a translation.
    [limi] [deo]

  - Added first cut on Plone 2.0 compatibility.
    [deo]

  - Fixed i18n domain everywhere... :-)
    [deo]


LinguaPlone 0.8.5 - Released September 6, 2005

  - Made content be created in neutral language, now that this concept
    works as expected.
    [deo]

  - Made addTranslation raise an AlreadyTranslated exception when trying
    to duplicate a translation.
    [deo]

  - Added form to create translation when the language don't exist and
    if the user has the appropriate permissions.
    [deo]

  - Title on the flag switcher should say: "Switch language to $LANGUAGE
    (content translation not available)" - the last part if the content
    is not translated, to complement the ghosting (which is purely visual,
    and bad for accessibility).
    [deo]

  - Split screen should change sides ("From" language to the left, "To"
    language to the right).
    [deo]

  - Split screen should not show short name if turned off (like the
    default is in 2.1).
    [deo]

  - Flags aren't on a separate line anymore (they used to be below the
    document actions).
    [limi]

  - Field titles are translated, field help is not.
    [deo]

  - Flags should probably be removed from the field titles, since the
    pulldown might make these misleading.
    [deo]

  - Split-screen pulldown needs language selectors when translating.
    [deo]

  - Use the translate_item template when editing translatable content,
    except the canonical one.
    [deo]

  - PloneLanguageTool has problems without LinguaPlone installed.
    [deo]

  - Added norwegian translation.
    [limi]

  - Improved i18n markup. Updated brazilian portuguese translation.
    [deo]

    place, and raising a exception when forbidden.
    [deo]

  - Design the policy for the New language negotiator.
    [limi]

  - Grayed out flags.
    [deo, limi]

  - Handle switching to non-existing language (a.k.a. not_available_lang).
    [deo]

  - Handle translation of default pages.
    [deo]

  - Added hasTranslation() method for grayed-out flags.
    [deo]

  - ID policy for translating containing folder and moving translated content.
    [limi]

  - Language switching: the URL on flags should be the actual URL, not
    switchLanguage?set_language=no.
    [deo]

  - Fixed languageswitcher in Firefox.
    [deo]

  - LinguaPlone should not append language code to ID, it should use
    the same Plone 2.1 policy.
    [deo]

  - Implemented the new language negotiator, where content and interface
    languages are always in sync.
    [deo]

  - Test that Images in ATCT are keeping the image LangIndependent.
    [limi]

  - Update dropdown menus markup.
    [deo]
